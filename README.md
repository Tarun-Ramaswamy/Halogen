# halogen
An attempt to create a simple and small graphics engine. This project uses SDL2 for windowing / input, and Vulkan for the graphics backend. 
The purpose of making this engine is to : try out graphics programming concepts, learn more about GPU's, and improve my programming skills.

# building the project
The bin directory contains two scripts. Use the build.sh script to build the project (Note : you will need a C++ 17 compiler and Cmake installed). Project is currently 
only tested on linux (Ubuntu 20.04) since it is being developed on it.
